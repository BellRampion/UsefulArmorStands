# Useful Armor Stands

This repo is a Valheim Plugin that allows you to interact with an armor stand while holding shift in order to automatically swap your currently equipped gear with what the armor stand is wearing.

There are configuration options to ignore individual item slots when performing the gear quick-swap.

Updated by BellRampion to work with the BogWitch update.
