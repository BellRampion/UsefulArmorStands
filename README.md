# Useful Armor Stands

This repo is a Valheim Plugin that allows you to interact with an armor stand while holding shift in order to automatically swap your currently equipped gear with what the armor stand is wearing.

This repository was forked from [GrischMods/QuickswapArmorstand](https://github.com/GrischMods/QuickswapArmorstand), but almost entirely rewritten to make it work with Mistlands
